  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  </center>
    <center>
    <p>Besides the introduction that was on the home page, this project which is more like a hobby started during our senior year of high school. Since it'll be tedious to have all of our artwork on just one instagram account, this website was made to sort this out.</p>

  <h2>Why is this website so bad?</h2>
  </center>
    <center>
    <p>The person making this website has practically zero knowledge to html and css. Hopefully with this website, he will improve (and also hate himself for such a bad foundation for the website.)</p>
